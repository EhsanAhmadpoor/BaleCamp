output:
useLayoutEffect
useEffect
because useLayoutEffect is asynchronous and useEffect
is synchronous meaning useLayoutEffect stops the whole 
code from execution until it executes itself
but useEffect doesn't. (useLayoutEffect runs before rendering.
useEffect runs after rendering)
if we want to know the scroll position before the page is
rendered and after the dom is manipulated then we should
use useLayoutEffect because it is more accurate and precise
cause it can read the scroll position and do whatever we want
before another render.
