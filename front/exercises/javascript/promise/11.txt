// 11-1.js

undefined
20
10

why?:
first the global variable x is declared and initialized with 10
then the variable x is hoisted in the top of example function scope but 
its not initialized so then it logs undefined. then its initialized with 20
and logs 20
after then it logs 10 because x variable in global scope is not modified
by example function

// 11-2.js

Happy birthday undefined
20
Happy birthday 20
21

why?:
arrow functions do not have their own this context. so there is no age in
global context which logs undefined.
the rest is obvious
